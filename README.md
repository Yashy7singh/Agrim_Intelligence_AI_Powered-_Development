🧠 Cursor Usage Documentation
🔹 3–5 Interesting Prompts Used

App Skeleton Creation

“Create a basic Personal Expense Tracker web app structure using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Include a form, list, filter panel, and stats section.”

Form Logic & Validation

“Implement a form to add expenses with amount, category, date, and description. Validate positive amounts and prevent future dates.”

Filtering System

“Add category and date range filters to the expense list. Include a ‘Clear Filters’ button to reset results.”

Statistics Dashboard

“Display total spending, total transactions, and spending by category dynamically using JavaScript.”

Dark Mode Feature

“Add a dark/light mode toggle button that saves user preference in localStorage.”

🔹 How Cursor Helped Solve Challenges

Faster Prototyping: Cursor’s AI autocompletion and prompt-based code generation saved time in creating boilerplate HTML/JS logic.

Debugging Assistance: Cursor highlighted logical errors in localStorage handling and suggested fixes for data parsing (JSON.parse() / JSON.stringify()).

Code Styling: Cursor’s inline suggestions improved readability and modularity, such as separating form validation logic into helper functions.

🔹 Modifications Made to AI-Generated Code

Improved Validation: The AI initially allowed “0” as an amount — manually fixed to enforce > 0.

Enhanced Responsiveness: Added custom CSS media queries instead of default inline styles.

Optimized LocalStorage Updates: Replaced repeated full refreshes with incremental DOM updates for better performance.
